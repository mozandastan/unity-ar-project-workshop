## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Unity Editor.
3. Open the `ARProject.unity` file located in the `Assets/Scenes` folder of the project.
4. Run the game to experience the AR application.

## How It Works
1. **Object Detection**: The application uses ARCore or ARFoundation to detect specific objects in the camera feed. When a target object is detected, the application triggers an action.
2. **Music Playback**: Upon detecting the target object, background music starts playing to enhance the AR experience.
3. **Virtual Object Placement**: A virtual object is placed on the screen in the vicinity of the detected real-world object. This virtual object serves as an interactive element in the AR scene.
4. **Object Interaction**: Users can interact with the virtual object by tapping on it. When the object is tapped, it explodes, indicating a successful interaction, and a new object spawns in its place.
5. **Scoring System**: Each successful interaction adds one point to the player's score, providing a gamified experience.
